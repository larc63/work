Instructions for use:
Select 2 search terms or let fate select them for you!
A list of recipes will appear, showing you pictures of the dishes. Tap on one to see the ingredient list.
You can like/heart the recipe to save it to your phone and you can visit the original source to see the steps for recreating the masterpiece!

Instructions for building:
All code and resources are included in the zip file.
The Food2Fork is limited to 500 requests per minute, so please don't hammer on it from a UI testing harness!

Next steps:
Add pagination while scrolling on the recipe list view
Modify the recipe list view to behave like on this example: http://www.raywenderlich.com/99087/swift-expanding-cells-ios-collection-views
Add pertinent error reporting for bad/slow networks
If possible, find a separate web service that can provide the steps in the recipes to add a cooking view with text-to-speech for each of the recipe's steps. This was a main feature for me, but dropped because Food2fork doesn't directly provide the steps for the recipes.
